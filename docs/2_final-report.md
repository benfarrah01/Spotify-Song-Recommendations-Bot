## Describe your approaches and experience with the project.

### What worked?

With this project we did a lot of splitting up work and then later checking eachothers work to catch possible errors. This was a very efficient way of going about the group work. Communication was key throughout the project. While working in diffrent branches, we would bounce ideas off of eachother and try diffrent methods we thought might work until we got one that we liked. We were almost always aware of what everyone was working on and we tried to be on the same page at all times. We would start with a very clumsy code and work on it till it was concise and ran smoothly. All of these approaches were very important to our success.

### What didn't?

We began the project by trying to create a few diffrent specific genre files that we would pull from. There were only 6 or so genres to pull from in this case. Therefore, when paired with our popularity identifier there was likely to be repeated songs for our tweets. This was also a much more difficult way to go about the issue. It had more moving parts and didn't run as well. Instead we created a single genre file that allowed us to utilize many more genres more efficiently.

### What would you have done differently?

We believe that there is always room for improvment when it comes to code. There is always something to add or to make more consise or make easier to use. Had we had more time I believe we would have added more ammenities to the bot in order to make it more appealing to users. We could have perhaps added extra astetics, explicit content protection, or even fun alternatives to just most popular. Maybe in the future we will be able to do so.


### What was the biggest challenge that you overcame? How did you do it?

One of the largest challenges we faced was feeling like we were getting close and then for the sake of improving our code and making our future progress easier, facing what seemed like set backs. We also had a difficult time creating our own empty dictionaries to use. We did solve that challenge only to be faced with new challenges in using those dictionaries. However, in the end we were able to overcome these challenges as a group and with a little help.

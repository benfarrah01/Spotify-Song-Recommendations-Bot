> Reflect on this using the list of potential ethical challenges highlighted in the [original ideas document](0_idea.md)

`In order to keep our bot as ethical as possible, it will require some upkeep on our part. If the bot suggests a song that is extremely explicit, we would remove the tweet and make sure it is removed from the pool of songs it could suggest. The Spotify API automatically removes songs from artists who are extraordinarily problematic or in the news due to their misconduct, so we do not have to worry about the bot recommending songs from unscrupulous artists. We also believe that bots should not try to appear human in any way. In order to make it obvious that our bot is NOT human, we will give it a name that implies it is a bot. We will also clearly state that it is a bot in the account's bio.`

# Course project final report

## Final title

Daily Song Recommendations tweet

## If you used any data sources, what were they and why?

The only data sources that we use is the Spotify API. The reason why is because it provides a channel between the user and the cloud of data we want to access. The data that we want to access are the Client ID and the secret ID. This is created by using our spotify developer account.  

## How did the final project end up? Were you able to achieve your ideal (or close to it)?

Our final project ended up similar to our initial thoughts where the idea is to pull the most popular song out of a specific genre. This song will be changed everyday, where the bot will tweet out a daily recommendation songs out of spotify. This is done by randomly choosing tyhe genre, then pick a song out of that genre based of the popularity of the song. The statement will be formatted with the song name and the song artists.  

## Did your project change over time? If so, how?

The project does not change over time that much because the process of the project is simple. The only change that we make is not to make every single file for every genre because it allows to make all the work more efficient. For example, if we make a mistake on one part, it will affect the overall result. Therefore, if we solve the problem, it will be solved for the overall result.

> Reflect on this using the list of potential ethical challenges highlighted in the [original ideas document](0_idea.md)

`In order to keep our bot as ethical as possible, it will require some upkeep on our part. If the bot suggests a song that is extremely explicit, we would remove the tweet and make sure it is removed from the pool of songs it could suggest. The Spotify API automatically removes songs from artists who are extraordinarily problematic or in the news due to their misconduct, so we do not have to worry about the bot recommending songs from unscrupulous artists. We also believe that bots should not try to appear human in any way. In order to make it obvious that our bot is NOT human, we will give it a name that implies it is a bot. We will also clearly state that it is a bot in the account's bio.`

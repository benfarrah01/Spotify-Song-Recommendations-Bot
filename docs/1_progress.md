## Celebrate your successes. What are they?

We got our developer id for the Spotify API. This was a huge step for group because all we need now is to 

## Highlight your group's most significant on-going challenge. How do you think you might solve it?

The most significant ongoing challenge is how we can actually pick the songs from the playlists to recommend daily. We had issues figuring out how to change the names of the songs from the playlist to the actual name because they ended up printing in code. We will still have to figure out this part that we have come across. We also had a challenge where the playlist was not printing fully and only printing a certain number of songs. We will have to solve these issues by getting help from stackoverflow or other spotify developers themselves. Another on-going challenge is how to actually get the bot to recommend the song at a specific time of the day and every day. We will also have to solve this by possibly using stackoverflow or getting help from TL or Professor Luman.

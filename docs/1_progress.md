## Using a Markdown `list`, detail the tasks you still have yet to do. Where are you stuck? Where do you need help?

* Getting the actual name of the song and artist. We have gotten the playlist for each day and genre but right now we are just getting random letters and numbers. We think that they are different songs but get more confused becuase there are only 15 lines that show up when there are definitly more than 15 songs in the plylist.
* To break it down a little more is that we need to get the name of the song and the name of the artist
* Another things that we need to figure out is how to post on a certain days for the certain genres. We have decide that for each day of the week that we will use a different file and post from a different song. This is somethign we plan to do when we get from break. 
* We need to be able to pick a random song from the selected playlist as well.


## Celebrate your successes. What are they?



## Highlight your group's most significant on-going challenge. How do you think you might solve it?

The most significant ongoing challenge is how we can actually pick the songs from the playlists to recommend daily. We had issues figuring out how to change the names of the songs from the playlist to the actual name because they ended up printing in code. We will still have to figure out this part that we have come across. We also had a challenge where the playlist was not printing fully and only printing a certain number of songs. We will have to solve these issues by getting help from stackoverflow or other spotify developers themselves. Another on-going challenge is how to actually get the bot to recommend the song at a specific time of the day and every day. We will also have to solve this by possibly using stackoverflow or getting help from TL or Professor Luman.

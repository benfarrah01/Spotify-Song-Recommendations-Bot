# Course project progress

## Using a Markdown `list`, detail the tasks you've completed and describe your progress.

* Create a spotify developer account. Only one person needs to create the account. The reason being is because we just need 1 client ID and secret ID to reference into the spotify account. 
* Download the spotify API to the Jupyter Notebook. Importing Spotipy. This allows to get all the spotify data from each user. 
* Create a python file for each genres we are going to use for the recommendations. 7 genres assigned for each day
* The python file will import the spotify playlist to the Jupyter Notebook 
* Create a main function which randomly choose a song from the assigned playlist for that day.

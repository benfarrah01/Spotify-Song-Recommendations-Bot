## Celebrate your successes. What are they?

So far in this project we have had many successes. We created python files for all of our diffrent genres to pick random songs. We figured out how to put the spodify API into jupider and pull our playlist selections from this source. We are getting more efficient at merging files together in the main. Finally, we are doing very well at splitting up work, communicating, and working as a group.

## Highlight your group's most significant on-going challenge. How do you think you might solve it?
